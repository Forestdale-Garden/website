				<h2>A successful summer cleanup!</h2>
				<p>Last Wednesday, several of our volunteers came out and cleaned up the site. We mowed, weed whacked the edges, pulled some invasives, and moved some hidden rocks that could easily damage mowers if they were hit. We also found some lower maintenance groundcover plants under the grass that, with the right encouragement, may not need to be mowed long term. What a difference!</p>
				<p>Thank you to Jessica for organizing, Ashley and John for providing fresh ice water and tools, and to everyone who stopped by to say hi and encourage us! It was so rewarding to make new connections and work on cleaning up the space together.</p>
				<h3>Before:</h3>
				<img src="../images/garden-before-06-24.jpg" alt="An empty yard full of tall grass and weeds. It generally looks overgrown.">
				<h3>After:</h3>
				<img src="../images/garden-after-06-24.jpg" alt="An empty yard with trimmed grass and no weeds. Some groundcover plants are now visible, and the rocks in the middle of the field are arranged nicely along the fence edge.">
				<p>Until this point, a kind neighbor had been paying to take care of this area on their own. The cleanup was a great reminder how important it is to foster community so that the responsibility for caring for this area is shared by more than one person, and how rewarding it is to care for our neighborhood together. We also received three lovely native plants as a donation which we're caring for as planning continues.</p>
				<p>We're currently looking at the week of July 8th for our next planning meeting. Stay tuned! If you would like to participate in a future cleanup event, be sure to sign up on our <a href="../volunteer/">volunteer page</a>.</p>

				<h2>May 29th community meeting notes</h2>
				<p>With many people returning from our first meeting, and some new voices, we were able to get some new feedback and direction on what general ideas the larger community is interested in for the garden area. A few new things we learned:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There's been a gap in maintenance that local residents have had to fill, especially with regards to mowing. Ari plans to follow up with the city to help find resources and assistance from the city to maintain this in the short term.</li>
					<li>Maintenance continues to be a concern. Currently, the area has a lot of grass, so it might be beneficial to consider low- or no-mow grass alternatives in this area, such as clover, or reducing the amount of plain grass that needs mowing to something smaller by adding flowers or other plants which need less hands-on maintenance.</li>
					<li>Ashley presented some initial ideas to react to, including garden beds, and we learned that the community prefers a more natural look, such as stone, that will last a long time without the need to replace or repair bed materials.</li>
					<li>Ari addressed concerns about what happens if maintenance falls behind - we'll simply take it down and allow the area to revert to its current state. Luckily, we've seen an increase in volunteer signups and expect this number to grow as the words gets out and plans become more finalized. While not all neighbors are avid gardeners, we saw some new faces this meeting who are passionate about plants too.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We also met our local tree warden, Chris Rosa, who has done amazing work with the Forestdale Cemetery, and offered some low-maintenance ideas which would bring beauty to the area, including forsythia, red-twig dogwood, and perrenials that could bloom throughout the season.</p>
				<p>We agreed that <strong>Wednesdays from 6:30pm-8:30pm in the Forestdale Elementary School cafeteria</strong> work well, and we expect our next meeting to be in a few weeks, probably towards the end of June. Next time, we'll be getting more active with planning and design ideas. Bring your plant suggestions and brainstorming ideas!</p>
				<p>Thank you to everyone who participated constructively at our last meeting! Your ideas and collaborative participation - especially when it comes to potential issues you forsee - are deeply appreciated. As always, please review our <a
					href="../faq/">FAQ page</a> for questions we have addressed at past meetings such as maintenance, ensuring we have volunteers, and pest management. If you would like to bring these topics up again, help us by letting us know what about the solution in the FAQ you feel isn't addressing the concern. This helps us find better solutions together. Hope to see you at the next meeting!</p>

				<h2>Save the date: May 29th, 2024 Planning Meeting!</h2>
				<p>Are you in the mood for planting? How about planning for planting?</p>
				<p><strong>Neighbors and gardeners, please save the date for our next planning meeting on May 29th, 2024 at
						Forestdale Elementary School from 6:30pm-8:30pm!</strong></p>
				<p>In this meeting, we'll introduce our new website, catch everyone up on the goals of this project, and
					gather input from the wider neighborhood. We'll also begin gathering volunteers and establish a more
					regular meeting schedule. Bring your best ideas and brainstorming attitude for eco-friendly pest and
					water management - check our our <a href="../blog/index.html#blog052024">latest blog post</a> for some
					initial inspiration!</p>

				<h2>Our first meeting!</h2>
				<p>Our first meeting on 3/20/2024 at Forestdale Elementary School was a success! The goal of our first
					meeting was
					to meet with homeowners abutting the vacant lot and introduce the idea of the garden, and get their
					feedback. This important first step helps us understand what the requirements of the garden will be, and
					we were lucky to have awesome participation. Some of our neighbors even helped spread the word when we
					had a hiccup with our mailings - thank you!</p>
				<p>We learned that maintaining the garden was the number one concern, especially with regards to pest
					management, the local coyote population, and ensuring the burden of upkeep is shared by more than one
					person. We also learned that it is important to keep costs low so as not to impact the neighborhood
					financially. We're already planning to ensure that these things are addressed - check out our <a
						href="../faq/">FAQ page</a> for complete, up to date details on how we're ensuring we address these
					points.</p>
				<p>Our next meeting will open the discussion up to more community members, and our goal will be to get more
					volunteers and support to make this idea sustainable!</p>
				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<img src="../images/notes-032024.jpg"
					alt="An illustration of a potential garden plan addressing pest management. Some features include using lavender and daffodils as natural rat repellent tactics. A raised bed at waist height could help discourage rats, rabbits, and coyotes while providing storage for community tools underneath. Meeting notes from the meeting are summarized underneath, and include key takeaways: get more organizers, keep costs down, consider pest management, and make the garden beautiful. Let's use the summer to plan and gather input!" />
