				<h2>Save the date: May 29th, 2024 Planning Meeting!</h2>

				<h2>Our first meeting!</h2>
				<p>Our first meeting on 3/20/2024 at Forestdale Elementary School was a success! The goal of our first
					meeting was
					to meet with homeowners abutting the vacant lot and introduce the idea of the garden, and get their
					feedback. This important first step helps us understand what the requirements of the garden will be, and
					we were lucky to have awesome participation. Some of our neighbors even helped spread the word when we
					had a hiccup with our mailings - thank you!</p>
				<p>We learned that maintaining the garden was the number one concern, especially with regards to pest
					management, the local coyote population, and ensuring the burden of upkeep is shared by more than one
					person. We also learned that it is important to keep costs low so as not to impact the neighborhood
					financially. We're already planning to ensure that these things are addressed - check out our <a
						href="../faq/">FAQ page</a> for complete, up to date details on how we're ensuring we address these
					points.</p>
				<p>Our next meeting will open the discussion up to more community members, and our goal will be to get more
					volunteers and support to make this idea sustainable!</p>
				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<img src="../images/notes-032024.jpg"
					alt="An illustration of a potential garden plan addressing pest management. Some features include using lavender and daffodils as natural rat repellent tactics. A raised bed at waist height could help discourage rats, rabbits, and coyotes while providing storage for community tools underneath. Meeting notes from the meeting are summarized underneath, and include key takeaways: get more organizers, keep costs down, consider pest management, and make the garden beautiful. Let's use the summer to plan and gather input!" />
