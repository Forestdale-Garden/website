					<h2>Volunteer with us!</h2>
					<p>Love the idea of contributing to the garden? We need help of all kinds! No matter what your skillset
						is,
						there are opportunities available for you to help. Not only will you get to contribute to a fun
						project - you'll also learn new skills and make connections in our neighborhood. Here are just a few
						ideas to get your imagination
						started:</p>

					<li><strong>No green thumb?</strong> No problem! Join our leadership team and attend planning meetings.
						Successful gardens need people who can plan, direct, and help make decisions!</li>
					<li><strong>Love gardening and landscaping?</strong> Help us plan and select plants that meet our
						neighborhood needs! We'll need lots of help with this for our first year, and after that, we'll want
						to decide on new annuals each spring.</li>
					<li><strong>Do you have a strong cultural connection with herbs, culinary, or gardening?</strong> Share
						your knowledge! One of the beautiful things about this small space is that we can use it to get to
						know each other better and honor Malden's rich, multicultural population. Let us know what plants or
						herbs represent you, and help us develop
						educational content around them for our website. It can be as simple as a recipe or as much as a
						workshop. Choose what works for you.</li>
					<li><strong>Do you have tools?</strong> You might like to help build! As we get closer to building the
						garden, we will need folks with tools and woodworking skills to help us create raised garden bed kits.
						We'll provide the materials, plans, and music. Your skills help us keep costs down for the whole
						neighborhood.</li>
					<li><strong>Not a fan of saws?</strong> After kits are done, we'll need lots of help to put
						together and fill garden beds. Learn a bit about woodworking without having to deal with saws at a bed
						kit building volunteer event!</li>
					<li><strong>Looking for a low-commitment, family-friendly activity?</strong> Join us for one of our
						weekly maintenance meetups! You'll get a quick tour of the garden plants, tips for care, and the
						opportunity to take home seasonal herbs and fresh flowers in exchange for your hard work weeding,
						fertilizing, and watering the plants.</li>
					<li><strong>Just want to learn a bit about gardening?</strong> After the garden is ready, we'll be able
						to create self-guided care activities for the garden, ranging from learning how to test if the soil
						needs water to how to identify common weeds amongst our plants. This gives everyone a quiet option for
						enjoying and caring for the garden on their own time. A great option for those who don't have their
						own land, but want to practice or learn the hobby!</li>
