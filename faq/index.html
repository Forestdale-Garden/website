			<details>
				<summary>Where will the garden be located?</summary>
				<p>We hope to grow the garden on a <a
						href="https://maldenma.mapgeo.io/datasets/committed?abuttersDistance=500&latlng=42.43718%2C-71.05888&previewId=091%20776%20612&share=2e0a64c0-85aa-4595-82ac-f9eb54722ab5&zoom=19&sidebar=false">strip
						of city-owned property on Goodwin Avenue</a>. The area we are hoping to
					use for the garden is the sunny area closest to 20 Goodwin Avenue. The shaded areas aren't as suitable
					for planting, and in some cases, are very close to homes where it wouldn't make as much sense to have
					garden activity.</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Who will maintain the garden?</summary>
				<p><a href="../leadership/">Ashley Kolodziej</a> has volunteered to be garden coordinator. She lives next to
					the proposed garden area and
					is able to keep an eye on simple day to day needs. However, great gardens take a village! We are
					actively looking for additional volunteers to help promote, maintain, and build the garden. Please <a
						href="../volunteer/index.html#volunteerform">sign up as a volunteer</a> if you're interested in
					helping out.</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>What stage is the garden at?</summary>
				<p>We're in the early stages of planning now, and focusing on gathering input and volunteers to make this a
					reality. You can help now by attending upcoming meetings or signing up to help with our leadership! <a
						href="../volunteer/">Learn more about volunteering</a> if you want to help now.</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Will the garden attract pests, such as rats?</summary>
				<p>Our goal is to build a garden that does not attract pests. We will incorporate this requirement into our
					plant selection and plans for building any garden beds. Some flowers, like lavender and daffodils, are
					even natural pest repellents, meaning that you may see a reduction in local pests if we plan this
					correctly.</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Will the garden increase the local coyote population?</summary>
				<p>No. As people who live in the neighborhood and have our own pets, we understand how important it is for
					our safety and our pets' safety to ensure we don't encourage additional coyote activity. By ensuring that
					we are integrating pest management planning and techniques into our build plan and
					plant choices, we will reduce pests such as rats and rabbits, which will reduce food sources for coyotes.
					The garden will
					also take a open, unattended area where a coyote could previously hang out and keep it more actively used
					and maintained. Our hope is that by maintaining the area, we can not only prevent an increase in coyotes
					as a result of the garden - perhaps we can even discourage them from congregating in our street in
					sheltered areas.</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>How will the garden be funded?</summary>
				<p>The garden will be funded primarily through outside grants. It will not use or affect the City of Malden
					budget. We plan to keep costs minimal while keeping the community involved by creating volunteer events
					where folks can help build garden boxes, plant seeds, and maintain the garden. We have lots of time to
					plan, so we expect that we can propagate or plant many of our plants from seed. We also plan to
					incorporate techniques that will reduce water usage and maintainance requirements, such as rain barrels
					and olla watering.</p>
