				<h2>Plants for pest management</h2>
				<span class="author" rel="author">By Ashley Kolodziej, Volunteer Garden Manager</span>
				<p>One of our big takeaways from the <a href="../news/index.html#news032024">first neighborhood garden
						planning meeting</a> was: how will we keep pests managed?</p>
				<p>One of the great things about nature and gardening is that nature often gives us a helping hand with pest
					management, if we take a minute to research and look in the right places. With that in mind, let's look
					at five of my favorite plants you can include in your garden to manage pests naturally.</p>
				<h3>Daffodils</h3>
				<p>Did you know daffodils are a <a
						href="https://www.housedigest.com/1441075/daffodil-plant-repel-rats-pest-garden/">natural rodent
						repellent</a>? These beautiful yellow flowers are one of the
					first
					to crop up in the spring and remind us all that better weather is just around the corner. Because
					daffodils are bulbs, they only need to be planted once, making them super easy to maintain from year to
					year.</p>
				<h3>Mint</h3>
				<p>While the mint plant itself won't repel rodents, as part of a mixture, <a
						href="https://www.gurneys.com/product/ybyg-of-mice-and-mint-and-mothballs">mint oil can be made into a
						spray that smells great and deters rodents</a>. Growing mint as part of a neighborhood herb garden can
					help us provide fresh mint for cooking to the neighborhood anytime we want, and when we have too much, we
					can let folks know that it's a good time to do a big harvest for repellent purposes. Mint is highly
					invasive, so if you choose to grow mint at home, make sure to do so in a container - not directly in the
					ground.</p>
				<h3>Sage</h3>
				<p>Who doesn't love sage at Thanksgiving? Besides being a fall staple, this amazing herb is a year-round
					hero in pastas, bright summery lemonades, and of course - <a
						href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/gardens/mouse-repellent-plants">rodent repellent</a>. You might
					be noticing a trend here - herbs are amazing pest repellents because of their highly aromatic nature. Can
					you guess the next plant on our list?</p>
				<h3>Rosemary</h3>
				<p>Like sage, rosemary has a strong scent that deters critters from the garden. Rosemary isn't typically a
					perennial in our planting zone, 6b, but some hardy varieties like <a
						href="https://sugarcreekgardens.com/product/rosemary-madeline-hill/">Hill Hardy</a> have been proven
					to survive in zones up to
					zone 6, making rosemary a potentially good choice for a low-maintenance plant we can use for cooking and
					pest maintenance. Besides being tasty in lemonade and soups, <a
						href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/06/04/bug-mosquito-repellent-plants/85400368/">rosemary
						even repels mosquitoes</a>!</p>
				<h3>Calendula</h3>
				<p><a href="https://baileyvantassel.com/calendula-in-the-kitchen-garden-a-deep-dive/">Calendula rounds out
						my list of favorite pest-repellent plants</a> for its sunny, beautiful blooms that last all summer
					long. Unlike marigolds, a similar looking cousin, some parts of calendula are edible, such as the petals.
					Like marigolds, though, they are a super easy annual to grow from seed in our zone. I've grown these both
					outdoors and hydroponically and you just can't beat them for beauty and utility in the garden.</p>
				<h3>What are your favorite pest-repellent plants?</h3>
				<p>Tell us at <a href="../news/index.html#news052024">our next meeting on May 29th, 2024 from
						6:30pm-8:30pm</a>! We're looking for volunteers and plant
					planning ideas for
					the space. I'd love to hear your input!</p>
