				<h3>Ashley Kolodziej</h3>
				<h4>Project and Garden Lead</h4>
				<p>Ashley Kolodziej is a part-time professor at Boston University and full-time design systems manager at
					Moody's Analytics. She has been gardening since she was a child, when her dad taught her how to grow
					potatoes, zucchini, pumpkins, and tomatoes. As a hobbyist, her gardening experience includes hydroponics,
					raised beds, chemical-free pest and weed management, seed saving, low-water techniques, propagation, and
					grafting with a focus on edible plants. A former creative director and manager, she also brings project
					planning and leadership experience to the table, passion and energy to motivate people to action, and an
					eye towards design, color, and beauty.</p>

			<blockquote>
				I'm excited to show people how beautiful and productive even small spaces like this can be, and pass on the
				gardening knowledge my dad gave me. My dream is to give neighbors in the area a space to work together to
				express their voices and interests through plants. I love cooking, so I would love to see edible plants like
				herbs. Some neighbors I've talked to are passionate about supporting local pollinators and growing flowers.
				Plants can even express our personal history and culture, from the herbs we use in our everyday cooking to
				the different gardening and growth practices we use across cultures, such as <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai_cultivation_and_care">bonsai</a> and <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olla">ollas</a>. It's no surprise to me how closely intertwined
				gardening practices are with art forms. This small space can represent us and help us learn more about each
				other, and the best part is that it can grow and change over time, just like our neighborhood does.
